# Element Fact Lookup
This web app lets you look up an element from a drop-down list and then lets you view the information about said element. This web app can also function as an API, just make a GET request to *REDACTED* and this returns a JSON response with all the information about a particular element. The data for all of the elements was retrieved from the [Periodic-Table-JSON](https://github.com/Bowserinator/Periodic-Table-JSON) repo by Bowserinator.
